 * button. That puts the drive's two "hold something" controls where each is actually reached for:
 * pause beside End and the trip figures, mute up with the other map controls, neither of them
 * behind a pop-out.
 *
 * Off restores the combined button in the stack (tap opens, second tap pauses, long press mutes).
 *
 * The bar's right slot is also where the step-list button goes when it is asked for, and that
 * button wins: `PreferButtons` and a keypad-first device asked for a discrete target, so taking it
 * away to make room for this one is the wrong trade. The chevron handle opens the step list on its
