 * Process-wide memory-pressure fan-out, in the same shape as the other app-level holders
 * (`TransitLayer`, `AppTheme`): `init()` from `VelaApp`, then anything holding a large or native
 * allocation registers a release callback.
 *
 * Why registration and not a Hilt entry point: reaching `WhisperRecognizer`/`PiperSynth` from
 * `onTrimMemory` through an EntryPoint would CONSTRUCT them if they had never been used, so a
 * trim would allocate the very models it is trying to free. A holder registers only once it
 * actually owns something worth releasing, so a trim can never create work.
 *
 * Measured on the M5 (2.9 GB, Android 13, standardDebug) before this existed: TRIM_MEMORY_COMPLETE
 * released 0 KB, because nothing in the app implemented ComponentCallbacks2 at all.
