/**
 * The nav side of the map screen, carved out of MapViewModel (issue #417, refactor 3, step 1):
 * starting, stopping, demo drives and trip replays, the nav-state observer that mirrors
 * [NavSession] into [MapUiState], tunnel dead reckoning, the per-route corridor fetches (controls,
 * speed cameras), the spoken warnings, the route bar and resume-after-process-death.
 *
 * State stays in the shared [MapUiState] flow the view model owns; what the nav code needs from
 * the rest of the view model (live GPS on/off, status cards, the speed-limit badge, route naming)
 * comes through [Host], so this class never reaches into the view model. Construct it ABOVE the
 * view model's `init`: [bind] launches the observer, whose first pass runs inline.
