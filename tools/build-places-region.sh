#
#   tools/build-places-region.sh <id> <S> <W> <N> <E> <out.pmtiles> [overture-release] [local.parquet]
#
# Needs duckdb (with httpfs + spatial), tippecanoe. Reads Overture straight from its public S3
# bucket unless a local parquet extract is given (a dev shortcut: the same columns, see the
# SELECT below). Business places only: parks, schools, civic and transit stay with OSM, whose
# area mapping is far better for them. Each feature carries the icon group the app already
# themes with, a prominence on the ambient layer's 0-9.5 scale (category prior, brand, contact
# details, Overture confidence), a rank within its ~400 m cell (`rank`) and within its ~1.6 km cell
# (`crank`) by that prominence, and a tippecanoe minzoom from the ranks: the best place in each
# 1.6 km cell is in the z13/z14 tiles, the top three per 400 m cell reach z15, the top twelve z16,
# everything z17. The app then decides per zoom which of the features in a tile get an icon, a
# label, or just a dot (VelaMapView), so a downtown thins to its landmarks the way Google's does
# and a village keeps its one cafe at z15.
#
# ALLTHEPLACES (2026-09-15): Overture's places come mostly from Meta and Bing, so a chain store
# with no Facebook page is simply absent. AllThePlaces (alltheplaces.xyz, CC0) scrapes every
# chain's OWN store locator weekly and publishes the result as one world PMTiles; the region's
# z15 tiles are pulled with `pmtiles extract` (a few range requests, seconds), decoded, filtered
# to real businesses by their OSM-style tags, and merged into the Overture rows: a locator point
# that has an Overture row of the same brand or the same leading name words within ~150 m is
# dropped, the rest join with a lower confidence than Overture's own. Chain rows carry
# `opening_hours`, which Overture never has. ATP_RUN=none skips it (also when the pmtiles or
# tippecanoe-decode binaries are missing); ATP_LOCAL points at a local extract for dev runs.
