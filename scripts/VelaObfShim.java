/**
 * Bakes a Vela obf. Default: the ROUTING section only, with the indexing passes routing does not
 * need switched off (multipolygons, route relations, proximity, country regions). Measured
 * 2026-09-04 on the same mid-sized US-state extract: the full routing+address+POI bake dies in
 * MapCreator's first pass at a 12 GB heap (as does routing-only with the default passes on), the
 * lean routing-only bake completes at 12 GB in 48 minutes and produces a 111 MB obf, against
 * 595 MB for OsmAnd's own roads-only file of the same state. That is what lets a free 16 GB
 * runner bake a US state at all. The engine (ObfRouteEngine) reads only the routing section.
 *
 * VELA_OBF_SECTIONS=routing,address,poi restores the phase-2 sections (offline search on obf),
 * at the old memory cost; VELA_OBF_LEAN=false restores MapCreator's default passes.
 * MainUtilities' CLI has no --no-map/--no-poi switches, only the settings object does.
 * Writes <Region>.obf next to the input, exactly like `generate-obf` would.
