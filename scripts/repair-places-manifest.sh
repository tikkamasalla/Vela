# Build places-overlay-manifest.json from whatever places-*.pmtiles archives sit on the
# places-overlays release: name and bounds from tools/places-regions.json (the bake's own entry
# carries the same catalog bbox), size from the release, rev from this run's entry when it has
# one, else the old manifest's rev when the archive is unchanged (same size), else the stamp
# given; a delta from the entry, else the `places-<id>.<oldrev>.vpatch` asset the bake published
# against the old rev, else the old manifest's delta when the rev did not move.
#
# This is the bake's MERGE as well as its repair. It used to fold this run's entries into the
# manifest, which made every archive depend on its own merge job surviving; a job that is pending
# in a concurrency group is CANCELLED when a newer one joins, so a 54-region wave on 2026-09-22
# lost 34 merges (and mailed every one of them). Deriving from the release makes a lost or racing
# merge cost nothing: the manifest is a function of what is published, and the assets are listed
# again after the upload, so a merge that was overtaken by a newer upload rebuilds once more.
