# Security policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting on this repository (Security tab,
"Report a vulnerability"). That opens a private thread with the maintainer; please
do not open a public issue for anything exploitable.

Worth reporting privately: anything that lets a third party push code or config to
installed apps (the calibration channel is ECDSA-signed against a pinned key, the
updater installs only same-signature APKs through the system installer; a way around
either is exactly what we want to hear about), leaks of user location or history off
the device, or a way to make the hidden WebViews run attacker-controlled script.

Not security bugs: Google changing a response shape (that's a calibration drift,
open a normal issue), the community OSRM server being down, or OSM data being wrong.

## What updates look like

There is no backend. A fix that lands on `main` ships in the next nightly (cut daily,
or at once for an urgent fix) and reaches the weekly stable at the next promotion, or
sooner through an early one. Every build is signed with the same key. Scraper-shape
fixes can also ship to every install within minutes through the signed remote
calibration file, without an app update.
