/**
 * A Street View panorama's metadata, resolved from a lat/lng by the keyless
 * `GeoPhotoService.SingleImageSearch` endpoint (the same one Google's own JS Maps API
 * uses - no API key, authorized by referer). Everything the in-app sphere viewer needs to
 * fetch tiles, orient the camera, walk to neighbors, and go back in time; the tiles
 * themselves come from `streetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com/v1/tile` (also keyless).
 *
 * The equirectangular image is a fixed 2:1 pyramid: at zoom `z` it is `512·2^z` wide by
 * `256·2^z` tall, cut into [tileSize]²  tiles. So a chosen zoom fully determines the tile
 * grid - see `StreetViewTiles`.
