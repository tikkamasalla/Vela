 * — they must be calibrated against a live capture of maps.google.com (see the
 * `CALIBRATE:` markers in `data/google/`). Search and directions were calibrated
 * on 2026-06-15 and now return real data; [app.vela.core.data.MockMapDataSource]
 * remains as an offline fallback so the whole UI still runs with no network.
