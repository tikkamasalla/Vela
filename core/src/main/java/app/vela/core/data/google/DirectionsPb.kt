/**
 * Builds the `pb` parameter for `/maps/preview/directions`.
 *
 * Captured from a live request and verified on 2026-06-15 for driving, walking
 * and cycling. Two calibration findings:
 *  - travel mode is the `!1e{N}` field inside the `!20m5` block —
 *    **0 = driving, 1 = cycling, 2 = walking, 3 = transit** (everything else is
 *    identical between modes), and
 *  - the optional `!15m3!1s<token>!7e81` session-token block was removed after
 *    confirming routes still come back without it.
 *
 * Driving returns traffic-aware ETAs + alternatives; walking/cycling return a
 * single route with no traffic; transit (3) uses a different response shape the
 * current parser doesn't read, so the UI offers drive / walk / bike only.

     *  request with "Avoid highways" ticked, 2026-09-06, and verified from a plain HTTP client:
     *  Davis to Sacramento flips from I-80 15.3 mi / 21 min to Old River Rd 27.1 mi / 46 min;
     *  Naperville to O'Hare with tolls avoided leaves the I-88/I-294 tollway for I-55/I-90). They
     *  are NOT in the `!20m` route-options group (every scalar there was probed with no effect)
     *  but in the `!6m` feature block's `!2m` submessage: `!1b1` = avoid highways, `!2b1` = avoid
     *  tolls, the same field numbers the web `dir/` URL's `!2m1!1b1` carries. Counts on the
     *  enclosing `!6m` and `!2m` groups grow by the number of flags added. Done by pattern so a
     *  recalibrated template (CalibrationStore) keeps working as long as that block survives.
     *
     *  Avoid ferries (issue #546, captured 2026-09-16 the same way with "Ferries" ticked) is a
     *  DIRECT child of that same outer `!6m` block, not of `!2m`: `!7b1` when ticked, `!7b0` when
     *  not, placed by field order after the nested `!6m..` group and before `!10b1`. Replaying one
     *  request with only that flag flipped swapped a ferry crossing for a long road detour. An
     *  existing `!7b` child is rewritten in place; otherwise `!7b1` is inserted and the outer count
     *  grows by one. */
