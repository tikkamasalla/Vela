/**
 * The drawn route line.
 *
 * Calibration (2026-06-15) established that Google's `/maps/preview/directions`
 * response carries NO decodable overview polyline — the web client renders the
 * line from vector tiles. So Vela sources the *geometry* from an open router
 * (OSRM, whose geometry is a standard E5 polyline [PolylineCodec] decodes
 * directly) while Google still provides the ETA, live traffic and maneuvers.
 * Same split the offline build will use, just with Valhalla as the engine.
 *
 * NOTE: [OSRM_BASE] is the FOSSGIS community server (fair-use, no key). It hosts
 * a separate backend per travel mode — `routed-car` / `routed-bike` /
 * `routed-foot` — which is why walk/bike get *their own* path-following line and
 * not a car route. (The old router.project-osrm.org demo only had the car
 * profile.) Point it at a self-hosted OSRM/Valhalla before any real release.
