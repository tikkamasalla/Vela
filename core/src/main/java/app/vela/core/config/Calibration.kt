/**
 * Remotely-updatable scraper calibration — the brittle bits that drift when
 * Google reshapes things: the `pb` templates and the endpoint URLs. Ships as
 * [DEFAULT]; [CalibrationStore] fetches a newer version from the public repo at
 * runtime so a fix lands without an app update ("push out the scraping").
 *
 * Phase 1 covers pb templates + endpoints; Phase 2 externalized the positional field-index paths
 * the parsers read (the `paths` object — `[1][39]`, `[1][10]`, …), so a moved field is also just an
 * edit + version bump. Genuinely new parsing *logic* still needs an app release (or a signed
 * transforms.js, phase 3); this fixes path/pb/endpoint drift.
